# Firebase Integration Task List for Swift/Vapor Webhook Relay

## Overview
This task list outlines the Firebase integration tasks for the Swift/Vapor webhook relay server. The relay acts as a bridge between Facebook Messenger, NaraServer, and iOS/macOS apps.

## Current Architecture
- **Language**: Swift 6.0 with Vapor framework
- **Purpose**: Relay Facebook webhooks to NaraServer and broadcast updates via SSE
- **Firebase SDK**: Using Firebase iOS SDK (limited server-side capabilities)

## Phase 1: Complete Firebase Analytics Implementation ‚úÖ (Partially Done)

### 1.1 Fix Firebase Analytics Import ‚ö†Ô∏è (Modified Approach)
- [x] Update `Package.swift` to properly include FirebaseAnalytics product
  - **Note**: Firebase Analytics is not available for server-side Swift
  - Using FirebaseCore only for configuration
- [x] Fix the Analytics import in `FirebaseService.swift`
  - Removed Analytics import as it's not available server-side
- [x] Update the `logEvent` method to actually send events to Firebase
  - Implemented structured local logging instead
  - Added TODO for custom analytics endpoint
- [ ] Test analytics events are appearing in logs (Firebase Console not applicable)

### 1.2 Enhance Current Analytics Events ‚úÖ
- [x] Add more detailed parameters to existing events:
  - `webhook_received`: Add webhook type, page_id
  - `message_forwarded`: Add response time, message size
  - `sse_connection`: Add client info, connection duration
  - `server_connection`: Add reconnection count, latency

### 1.3 Add New Analytics Events ‚úÖ
- [x] `relay_started` - When the relay server starts
- [x] `relay_shutdown` - Clean shutdown events
- [x] `error_occurred` - Track errors with categories
- [x] `api_proxy_request` - Track proxy endpoint usage
- [x] `rate_limit_exceeded` - Track rate limiting events

## Phase 2: Enhanced Error Tracking and Monitoring

### 2.1 Structured Error Logging ‚úÖ
- [x] Create error categories enum:
  ```swift
  enum ErrorCategory: String {
      case webhookProcessing = "webhook_processing"
      case naraServerConnection = "nara_server_connection"
      case sseDelivery = "sse_delivery"
      case configuration = "configuration"
      case rateLimit = "rate_limit"
  }
  ```
- [x] Log errors with Firebase Analytics including:
  - Error category
  - Error message
  - Stack trace (if available)
  - Request context

### 2.2 Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Track and log performance metrics:
  - Webhook processing time
  - NaraServer forwarding latency
  - SSE broadcast time
  - Memory usage snapshots
- [ ] Create performance thresholds and alert when exceeded

## Phase 3: Configuration Management

### 3.1 Environment-Based Configuration
- [ ] Create a `ConfigurationManager` to centralize all config:
  ```swift
  actor ConfigurationManager {
      // Rate limiting config
      var maxRequestsPerMinute: Int
      var sseHeartbeatInterval: TimeInterval
      var webhookTimeout: TimeInterval
      var maxRetryAttempts: Int
      // etc.
  }
  ```
- [ ] Load configuration from environment variables with defaults
- [ ] Add configuration validation on startup

### 3.2 Dynamic Configuration Updates (Future)
- [ ] Research Firebase Remote Config availability for server-side Swift
- [ ] If not available, implement alternative solution:
  - Periodic config fetch from NaraServer
  - Config update via admin endpoint
  - Config stored in a simple JSON file

## Phase 4: Security Enhancements

### 4.1 Request Validation
- [ ] Add request origin validation for SSE connections
- [ ] Implement API key validation for proxy endpoints
- [ ] Add request signing for NaraServer communication
- [ ] Log all security-related events to Firebase

### 4.2 Rate Limiting Improvements
- [ ] Make rate limiting configurable per endpoint
- [ ] Add different rate limit tiers (IP-based, authenticated)
- [ ] Track rate limit violations in Firebase Analytics
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for repeat offenders

## Phase 5: Reliability Improvements

### 5.1 Connection Management
- [ ] Implement connection pool for NaraServer requests
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern for NaraServer failures
- [ ] Improve WebSocket reconnection logic with jitter
- [ ] Track all connection state changes in Firebase

### 5.2 Message Queue (In-Memory)
- [ ] Implement in-memory queue for failed webhook forwards
- [ ] Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- [ ] Set maximum queue size and overflow handling
- [ ] Log queue statistics to Firebase

## Phase 6: Monitoring Dashboard Integration

### 6.1 Health Check Enhancements
- [ ] Add Firebase connection status to health check
- [ ] Include more detailed metrics:
  - Uptime
  - Total webhooks processed
  - Current queue size
  - Error rate (last 5 minutes)
  - Average response time

### 6.2 Metrics Endpoint
- [ ] Create `/metrics` endpoint with Prometheus-compatible format
- [ ] Include custom metrics:
  - `webhook_relay_connections_active`
  - `webhook_relay_messages_forwarded_total`
  - `webhook_relay_errors_total`
  - `webhook_relay_response_time_seconds`

## Phase 7: Testing and Validation

### 7.1 Unit Tests
- [ ] Test Firebase initialization
- [ ] Test analytics event logging
- [ ] Test error tracking
- [ ] Test configuration loading

### 7.2 Integration Tests
- [ ] Test full webhook flow with Firebase logging
- [ ] Test SSE delivery with analytics
- [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery
- [ ] Verify all events appear in Firebase Console

### 7.3 Load Testing
- [ ] Test with high webhook volume
- [ ] Monitor Firebase quota usage
- [ ] Verify no event loss under load
- [ ] Check memory usage patterns

## Phase 8: Documentation and Deployment

### 8.1 Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README with Firebase features
- [ ] Document all analytics events
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add Firebase Console setup instructions

- [ ] Add Firebase environment variables to deployment scripts
- [ ] Create monitoring alerts based on Firebase data
